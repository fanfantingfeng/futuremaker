## Array creation
有6种创建array的技术:
1. Conversion from other Python structures(list, tuple, etc.)
2. Intrinsic(固有) NumPy array creation functions.
3. Replicating, joining, or mutating(转换) existing arrays.
4. Reading arrays from disk, either from standard or custom formats.
5. Creating arrays from raw bytes through the use of strings or buffers.
6. Use of special library functions.
