NumPy(*Numerical Python*) is an open source Python library that's widely used in science and engineering.
```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
			  [4, 5, 6]])
a.shape
```
## Why NumPy?
Python lists are excellent, general-purpose containers. They can contain elements of a variety of types, and they are quite fast when used to perform individual operations on a handful of elements.
>Depending on the characteristics of the data and the types of operations that need to be performed, other containers may be more appropriate; by exploiting these characteristics, we can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and offer a high-level syntax for performing a variety of common processing tasks.
**Numpy shines when there are large quantities of "homogeneous" data to be processed on the CPU.**
## array
A structure for storing and retrieving(检索) data.
We often talk about an array as if it were a grid in space, with each cell storing one element of the data. For instance, if each element of the data were a number, we might visualize a **"one-dimensional"** array like a *list*;
A **two-dimensional** array would be like a *table*.
A **three-dimensional** array would be like *a set of tables*, perhaps stacked as though they were printed on separate pages. 
In NumPy, this idea is generalized to an arbitrary number of dimensions, and so the fundamental array class is called ==ndarray==: it represents an "N-dimensional array".

Most NumPy arrays have some restrictions:
- All elements of the array must be of the same type of data;
- Once created, the total size of the array can't change;
- The shape must be "rectangular(矩形)", not "jagged(参差不齐的)";
**When these conditions are met, NumPy exploits these characteristics to make the array faster, more memory efficient, and more convenient to use than less restrictie data structures.**

#### Array fundamentals
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
a[0]  #1
a[0] = 10  #the array is mutable.
a[0]  #10

b = a[:3]  #切片可用于索引

```
