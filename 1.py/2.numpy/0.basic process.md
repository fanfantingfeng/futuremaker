NumPy(*Numerical Python*) is an open source Python library that's widely used in science and engineering.
```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
a.shape
```
## Why NumPy?
Python lists are excellent, general-purpose containers. They can contain elements of a variety of types, and they are quite fast when used to perform individual operations on a handful of elements.
>Depending on the characteristics of the data and the types of operations that need to be performed, other containers may be more appropriate; by exploiting these characteristics, we can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and offer a high-level syntax for performing a variety of common processing tasks.
**Numpy shines when there are large quantities of "homogeneous" data to be processed on the CPU.**
## array
A structure for storing and retrieving(检索) data.
We often talk about an array as if it were a grid in space, with each cell storing one element of the data. For instance, if each element of the data were a number, we might visualize a **"one-dimensional"** array like a *list*;
A **two-dimensional** array would be like a *table*.
A **three-dimensional** array would be like *a set of tables*, perhaps stacked as though they were printed on separate pages. 
In NumPy, this idea is generalized to an arbitrary number of dimensions, and so the fundamental array class is called ==ndarray==: it represents an "N-dimensional array".

Most NumPy arrays have some restrictions:
- All elements of the array must be of the same type of data;
- Once created, the total size of the array can't change;
- The shape must be "rectangular(矩形)", not "jagged(参差不齐的)";
**When these conditions are met, NumPy exploits these characteristics to make the array faster, more memory efficient, and more convenient to use than less restrictie data structures.**
注: 以下使用"array"来指代 ndarray.
#### Array fundamentals
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
a[0]  #1
a[0] = 10  #the array is mutable.
a[0]  #10

b = a[:3]  #切片可用于索引

```
在Python的列表中, slice indexing将复制列表元素到新的列表中.
在ndarray中, slicing an array只返回一个view(视图):
- an object that refers to the data in the original array.
- The original array can be mutated using the view.
```python
b = a[3:]
b[0] = 40
a[3] == 40  #true
```
[[Copies and views]]呈现了关于在NumPy array中的复制与视图的详细说明!

Two-and higher-dimensional arrays can be initialized from nested Python sequences:
```python
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])
```
A dimension of an array is sometimes referred to as an "axis".
This terminology may be useful to disambiguate between the dimensionality of an array and the dimensionality of the data represented by the array. For instance, the array ==a== could represent three points, each lying within a four-dimensional space, but ==a== has only two "axes".
Another difference between an array and a list of lists is that an element of the array can be accessed by specifying the index along each axis within a single set of square brackets, separated by commas.
For instance, the element ==8== is in row ==1== and column ==3==:
```python
a[1, 3]
```
>A better mental model is to think of the column index as coming last and the row index as second to last.
>This generalizes to arrays with any number of dimensions.

#### Array attributes
- ndarray.ndim: The number of dimensions of an array.
- ndarray.shape: The shape of an array is a tuple of non-negative integers.
- ndarray.size: The fixed, total number of elements in array.
- ndarray.dtype: The data type.
```python
a = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3)
a.ndim   #2
a.shape  #(3,3)
a.size   #9
import math
a.size == math.prod(a.shape)  #True
a.dtype  #dtype('int64')   int for integer, 64 for 64-bit
```
#### Create a basic array
创建元素全为0的array:
```python
np.zeros(2)
np.zeros((3, 4))
np.zeros((3, 4, 5))
```
创建元素全为1的array:
```python
np.ones(2)
np.ones((3, 4))
np.ones((3, 4, 5))
```
甚至创建全空的array, ==np.empty()== 创建元素初始值为随机(random)的array, 随机值依赖于存储器的状态(state of the memory).
使用 ==np.empty()== 而非==np.zeros()== 主要考虑速度因素:
```python
np.empty(2)  
```
使用连续元素创建array:
```python
np.arange(4)
np.arange(2, 9 ,2)
```
创建包含线性序列元素的array:
```python
np.linspace(0, 10, num=5)
```
创建array时指定 dtype:
```python
x = np.ones(2, dtype=np.int64)
```

#### Adding, removing, and sorting
通过==np.sort()==来简单排序array, 可指定axis, kind, order.
```python
arr = np.array([2, 1, 5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 8])
np.sort(arr)  #并不会改变arr原本的排序, 本质上是排序copy
```
==np.sort()==返回的是排序后的copy, 作为补充, 还有其他的排序方法可用:
- **argsort**: an indirect sort along a specified axis;
- **lexsort**: an indirect stable sort on multiple keys;
- **searchsorted**: find elements in a sorted array;
- **partition**: partial sort.
详细说明详见: [[sort]]

##### 合并array
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])
np.concatenate((a,b))  
#array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

#对于二维以上数据的合并, 需要指定axis
x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
y = np.array([[5, 6]])
np.concatenate((x, y), axis=0)
z = np.array([[5], [6]])
np.concatenate((x, z), axis=1)
```
如果需要从array中删除元素, 最简单的方式是通过indexing来筛选出需要的元素.

#### 关于shape和size
==ndarray.ndim== will tell you the number of axes, or dimensions, of the array.
==ndarray.size== will tell you the total number of elements of the array. The **product** of the elements of the array's shape.
==ndarray.shape== will display a tuple of integers that indicate the number of elements stored along each dimension of the array.
```python
arr = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3)
arr.ndim   #2
arr.size   #9
arr.shape  #(3,3)
```
==ndarray.reshape()== will give a new shape to an array without changing the data.
```python
a = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
```
通过 np.reshape(), 可以指定额外的参数:
```python
np.reshape(np.arange(12), newshape=(3, 4), order="C")
```
==newshape==可以指定整数(默认为array长度)或者整数元组.
==order== means to read/write the elements using C-like or Fortran-like index order. A means to read/write the elements in Fortran-like index order if a is Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order otherwise.
>In Fortran, when moving through the elements of a two-dimensional array as it is stored in memory, the **first** index is the most rapidly varying index. As the first index moves to the next row as it changes, the matrix is stored one column at a time. This is why Fortran is thought of as a **Column-major language**.
>In C on the other hand, the **last** index changes the most rapidly. The matrix is stored by rows, making it a **Row-major language**.
>What you do for C or Fortran depends on whether it's more important to preserve the indexing convention or not reorder the data.

#### 关于添加new axis
通过np.newaxis和np.expand_dims来增加array的维度.
np.newaxis 每次只增加1个维度:
```python
a = np.arange(1, 7, 1)
a.shape   #(6, )
a2 = a[np.newaxis, :]
a2.shape   #(1, 6)
a3 = a[:, np.newaxis]
a3.shape   #(6, 1)
a4 = a2[:, np.newaxis]
a4.shape   #(1, 1, 6)
```
np.expand_dims 在指定位置插入一个新的axis;
```python
b = np.expand_dims(a, axis=1)
b.shape   #(6, 1)
c = np.expand_dims(a, axis=0)
c.shape   #(1, 6)
```

#### 索引(indexing)与切片(slicing)
You can index and slice NumPy arrays in the same ways you can slice Python lists.
You may want to take a section(部分) of your array or specific array elements to use in further analysis or additional operations. To do that, you'll need to subset, slice, and/or index your arrays.
```python
a = np.arange(1,13,1).reshape(3, 4)
print(a[a < 5])
#[1 2 3 4]

five_up = (a >= 5)
print(a[five_up])

print(a[a%2 == 0])

c = a[(a > 2) & (a < 11)]
d = a[(a > 5) | (a == 5)]
```
np.nonzero()用于选择array中的元素或索引.
```python
a = np.arange(1, 13,1).reshape(3, 4)
b = np.nonzero(a < 5)
print(b)
#(array([0, 0, 0, 0]), array([0, 1, 2, 3]))
```
在上面的例子中, 返回的是两个array组成的元组, 每个维度都返回一个.
The first array represents the row indices where these values are found, and the second array represents the column indices where the values are found.
If you want to generate a list of coordinates(坐标) where the elements exist, you can zip the arrays, iterate over the list of coordinates, and print them.
```python
list_of_coordinates = list(zip(b[0], b[1]))
for coord in list_of_coordinates:
	print(coord)
```
通过np.nonzero()能将符合条件的元素都筛选出来:
```python
print(a[b])
```
如果array中没有满足条件的元素, 将返回空array.

#### Create an array from existing data
```python
a = np.arange(1, 11, 1)
arr1 = a[3:8]

a1 = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2]])
a2 = np.array([[3, 3], [4, 4]])
#垂直(vertically)堆栈
np.vstack((a1, a2))
#水平(horizontally)堆栈
np.hstack((a1, a2))
```
通过==np.hsplit==来将array进行拆分.
```python
x = np.arange(1, 25).reshape(2, 12)

#将x进行3等分
np.hsplit(x, 3)

#在x的第3列和第4列进行拆分
np.hsplit(x, (3, 4))
```
通过 ==ndarray.view()==方法来创建一个新的与原数据一样的array对象.
一般来说, 普通的indexing和slicing操作都将产生原数据的view.
需要注意的是, 对于view的修改同样会作用于原数据.
```python
a = np.arange(1,13,1).reshape(3, 4)
b1 = a[0, :]
b1[0] = 99
a[0, 0] == 99  #True
```
通过==ndarray.copy()==方法能创建一个和原数据完全一样的独立的array.
```python
b2 = a.copy()
```

#### array的基础运算
```python
a = np.array([1, 2])
b = np.ones(2, dtype=int)
a + b  #array[2, 3]
a - b  #array([0, 1])
a * b  #array(1, 2)
a / b  #array(1., 2.)
```
ndarray.sum() 求和
```python
a = np.arange(1, 5)
a.sum()   #10

b = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2]])
b.sum(axis=0)  #array([3, 3])
b.sum(axis=1)  #array([2, 4])
```

#### 广播(broadcasting)
There are times when you might want to carry out an operation between an array and a single number or between arrays of two different sizes.
```python
data = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
data * 1.6    #array([1.6, 3.2])
```
NumPy understands that the multiplication should happen with each cell. The concept is called **broadcasting**.
Broadcasting is a mechanism that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes. The dimensions of your array must be compatible(兼容的), for example, when the dimensions of both arrays are equal or when one of them is 1.
If the dimensions are not compatible, you will get a ==ValueError==.

#### More useful array operations
```python
data = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
data.max()   #2.0
data.min()   #1.0
data.sum()   #3.0

arr = np.arange(1, 13).reshape(3,4)
arr.sum(axis=0)   #array([15, 18, 21, 24])
arr.sum(axis=1)   #array([10, 26, 42])
arr.min()   #np.int64(1)
arr.min(axis=1)   #array([1, 5, 9])
```

#### 矩阵(matrices)
You can aggregate all the values in a matrix and you can aggregate them across columns or rows using the ==axis== parameter.
```python
data = np.arange(1, 7, 1).reshape(3,2)
data.max(axis=0)
data.min(axis=1)
```
对于两个大小规格相同的matrice, 可以进行数学运算:
```python
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.ones(4, dtype=int).reshape(2,2)
a + b   #array([[2, 3], [4, 5]])
```
You can do these arithmetic operations on matrices of different sizes, but only if one matrix has only one column or one orw.  In this case, NumPy will use its broadcast rules for the operation.
```python
data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
ones_row = np.array([[1, 1]])
data + ones_row  #array([[2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7]])
```
**Be aware that when NumPy prints N-dimensional arrays, the last axis is looped(环/循环/回路) over the fastest while the first axis is the slowest.**
There are often instances where we want NumPy to initialize the values of an array.
NumPy offers functions like ==np.ones(), np.zeros(), np.random.Generator== class for random number generation for that.
```python
np.ones(3)
np.zeros(3)
rng = np.random.default_rng()  #the simplest way to generate random numbers
rng.random(3)

np.ones((3, 2))
np.zeros((3, 2))
rng.random((3, 2))
```

#### 随机数
The use of random number generation is an important part of the configuration and evaluation of many numerical and machine learning algorithms(算法).
Whether you need to randomly initialize weights in an *artificial neural network*(人工神经网络), split data into random sets, or randomly shuffle(打乱次序/洗牌) your dataset, being able to generate random numbers(actually, repeatable pseudo(伪)-random numbers) is essential.  With ==Generator.integers==, you can generate random integers from low to high (exclusive). You can set ==endpoint=True== to make the high number inclusive.
```python
rng = np.random.default_rng()
rng.integers(5, size=(2, 4))
```

#### Get unique items and counts
```python
a = np.array([11, 11, 12, 13, 12, 14, 15, 19])
unique_values = np.unique(a)
print(unique_values)
```
如果需要同时返回uniqe values对应的第一个index序列, 设置==return_index==参数为True即可:
```python
unique_values, indices_list = np.unique(a, return_index=True)
print(indices_list)
```
如果需要获取每个元素的出现次数, 可以将==return_counts==设置为True:
```python
unique_values, occurrence_count = np.unique(a, return_counts=True)
print(occurrence_count)
```
np.unique对于多维array同样适用, 如果未指定axis, 多维array将会被flattened.
如果想要获取unique rows or columns, 需要执行axis.
```python
a_2d = np.array([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[1,2,3,4]])
unique_rows = np.unique(a_2d, aixs=0)

#To get the unique rows, index position, occurrence count
unique_rows, indices, occurrence_count = np.unique(a_2d, axis=0, return_counts=True, return_index=True)
print(unique_rows)
print(indices)
print(occurrence_count)
```

#### Transposing and reshaping a matrix
It's common to need to transpose your matrices.
NumPy arrays have the property ==T== that allows you to transpose a matrix.
You many also need to switch the dimensions of a matrix. This can happen when, for example, you have a model that expects a certain input shape that is different from your dataset. This is where the ==reshape== method can be useful.
```python
data = np.arange(1, 7, 1).reshape(3, 2)
data.T
data.reshape(2, 3)
```
You can also use ==.transpose()== to reverse or change the axes of an array according to the values you specify.
```python
arr = np.arange(6).reshape((2, 3))
arr.transpose()
```

#### Reverse an array
NumPy's ==np.flip()== function allows you to flip(快速翻转), or reverse(颠倒), the contents of an array along an axis. 
When using ==np.flip()==, specify the array you would like to reverse and the axis. If you don't specify the axis, NumPy will reverse the contents along all of the axes of your input array.
```python
arr = np.arange(1,9,1)
reversed_arr = np.flip(arr)

arr_2d = np.arange(1,13,1).reshape(3,4)
r_arr = np.flip(arr_2d)
reversed_arr_rows = np.flip(arr_2d, axis=0)
```
You can also reverse the contents of only one column or row.
```python
arr_2d[1] = np.flip(arr_2d[1])
arr_2d[:, 1] = np.flip(arr_2d[:, 1])
```

#### Reshaping and flattening multidimensional arrays
There are two popular ways to flatten an array: ==.flatten()== and ==.ravel()==.
The primary difference between the two is that the new array created using ==ravel()== is actually reference to the parent array(**view**). This means that any changes to the new array will affect the parent array as well.  由于ravel并不创建copy, 因此在内存上更有效率.
```python
x = np.arange(1,13).reshape(3, 4)
a1 = x.flatten()    
a1[0] = 99
print(x[0])    #1

a2 = x.ravel()
a2[0] = 88
print(x[0])  #88
```

#### How to access the docstring for more information
When it comes to the data science ecosystem(生态系统), Python and NumPy are built with the user in mind. One of the best examples of this is the built-in access to documentation.
Every object contains the reference to a string, which is known as the **docstring**. In most cases, this docstring contains a quick and concise summary of the object and how to use it.
Python has a built-in ==help()== function that can help you access this information. This means that nearly any time you need more information, you can use it to quickly find the information that you need.

Ipython uses the ==?== character as a shorthand for accessing this documentation along with other relevant information.
Using a double question mark ==??== allows you to access the source code.
If the object in question is compiled in a language other than Python, using ==??== will return the same information as ==?==. You'll find this with a lot of built-in objects and types.
```python
len?
len??
```

#### Working with mathematical(数学) formulas(公式)
The ease(容易) of implementing mathematical formulas that work on arrays is one of the things that make NumPy so widely used in the scientific Python community.
![[数学公式-numpy.png]]
在NumPy中可这样书写:
```python
error = (1/n) * np.sum(np.square(predictions - labels))
```
What makes this work so well is that ==predictions== and ==labels== can contain one or a thousand values. They only need to be the same size.

#### How to save and load NumPy objects
You will, at some point, want to save your arrays to disk and load them back without having to re-run the code. Fortunately, there are several ways to save and load objects with NumPy.
The ndarray objects can be saved to and loaded from the disk files with ==loadtxt== and ==savetxt== functions that handle normal text files, ==load== and ==save== functions that handle NumPy binary files with a **.npy** file extension, and a ==savez== function that handles NumPy files with a **.npz** file extension.

The **.npy** and **.npz** files store data, shape, dtype, and other information required to reconstruct the ndarray in a way that allows the array to be correctly retrieved(检索), even when the file is on another machine with different architecture(结构).

If you want to store a single ndarray object, store it as a **.npy** file using ==np.save==. 
If you want to store more than one ndarray object in a single file , save it as a **.npz** file using ==np.savez==.
You can also save several arrays into a single file in compressed npz format with ==savez_compressed==.

It's easy to save and load an array with ==np.save()==. Just make sure to specify the array you want to save and a file name.
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
np.save('filename', a)

b = np.load('filename.npy')
```
You can save a NumPy array as a plain text file like a **.csv** or **.txt** file with ==np.savetxt==.
```python
csv_arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
np.savetxt('new_file.csv', csv_arr)

np.loadtxt('new_file.csv')
```
The ==savetxt()== and ==loadtxt()== functions accept additional optional parameters such as header, footer, and delimiter.
While text files can be easier for sharing **.npy** and **.npz** files are smaller and faster to read. If you need more sophisticated(复杂的) handling of your text file, you will want to use the ==genfromtxt== function.

##### Importing and exporting a CSV
It's simple to read in a CSV that contains existing information.
The best and easiest way to do this is to use **Pandas**.
```python
x = pd.read_csv('music.csv', header=0).values
print(x)

#You can also simply select the columns you need:
x = pd.read_csv('music.csv', usecols=["Artist", "Plays"]).values
print(x)
```
It's simple to use Pandas in order to export your array as well. If you are new to NumPy, you may want to create a Pandas dataframe from the values in your array and then write the dataframe to a CSV file with Pandas.

#### Plotting arrays with Matplotlib
```python
a = np.array([2, 1, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, 14, 10, 9, 18, 20, 22])
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#If you're using Jupyter Notebook, you may also want to run the following
#line of code to display your code in the notebook:
%matplotlib inline
plt.plot(a)
#If you are running from a command line, you may need to do this:
plt.show()

```
Some example:
```python
x = np.linspace(0, 5, 20)
y = np.linspace(0, 10, 20)
plt.plot(x, y, 'purple')  #line
plt.plot(x, y, 'o')   #dots
```
With Matplotlib, you have access to an enormous(巨大的/庞大的) number of visualization options:
```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')
X = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.15)
Y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.15)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
Z = np.sin(R)

ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=1, cstride=1, cmap='viridis')
```
